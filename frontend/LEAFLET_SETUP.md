# Leaflet Map Integration - No API Key Required! 🎉

## Why Leaflet?

✅ **100% Free** - No API key required  
✅ **No Usage Limits** - Use as much as you want  
✅ **Open Source** - Community-driven  
✅ **OpenStreetMap** - Free map tiles  
✅ **Perfect for Testing** - Works immediately  
✅ **Lightweight** - Fast and efficient

## Quick Start

**No setup required!** The map works out of the box.

1. **Start the dev server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to `/properties`** and click the map view toggle

3. **That's it!** The map should display immediately.

## How It Works

- Uses **OpenStreetMap** tiles (completely free)
- Powered by **Leaflet** (open-source mapping library)
- No API keys, no registration, no limits!

## Features

- ✅ Interactive map with property markers
- ✅ Click markers to see property summary cards
- ✅ Zoom and pan controls
- ✅ "Search as I move" functionality
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Works offline (after initial load)

## Customization

### Change Map Style

You can use different tile providers in `PropertyMapView.tsx`:

```typescript
// Default OpenStreetMap
<TileLayer url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" />

// CartoDB (alternative style)
<TileLayer url="https://{s}.basemaps.cartocdn.com/light_all/{z}/{x}/{y}.png" />

// Stamen (watercolor style)
<TileLayer url="https://stamen-tiles-{s}.a.ssl.fastly.net/watercolor/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg" />
```

### Custom Markers

You can customize marker icons by modifying the `Marker` component in `PropertyMapView.tsx`.

## Comparison with Other Solutions

| Feature             | Leaflet (Current) | Google Maps       | Mapbox            |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| API Key Required    | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes            |
| Free Tier           | ✅ Unlimited      | ⚠️ $200/month     | ⚠️ Limited        |
| Setup Complexity    | ✅ Easy           | ⚠️ Medium         | ⚠️ Medium         |
| Open Source         | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No             | ❌ No             |
| Perfect for Testing | ✅ Yes            | ⚠️ Requires setup | ⚠️ Requires setup |

## Troubleshooting

### Map Not Displaying?

1. **Check browser console** for errors
2. **Verify CSS is loaded** - Leaflet CSS should be imported
3. **Check network tab** - Map tiles should load from OpenStreetMap

### Markers Not Showing?

- Ensure properties have `latitude` and `longitude` values
- Check that coordinates are valid (between -90 to 90 for lat, -180 to 180 for lng)

## Production Considerations

For production, you might want to:

1. **Use a tile server** - Consider using your own tile server or a CDN
2. **Add caching** - Cache map tiles for better performance
3. **Rate limiting** - OpenStreetMap has usage policies (very generous for normal use)
